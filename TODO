TODOs / Ideas:

 * Create test file without any other text for comparision between differnt compilers.
 * Same for foreground: bgimage?
 * Might be generalised to allow overlays (\overlaybox{<background content>}{<foreground content>})
 * Finish & test: splitbox, pagebreakbox & keys
 * width, Width, WIDTH etc. lengths
 * Provide \Textwidth which should stand for the outer textwidth and not change.
